# MAXART_ProgrammingTest_AXEL_2020-01

Brief

Maxart has created a basic Pong game for a client event. The client has provided a number of changes they want implemented: score tracking system to display who is winning the game, a defeatable AI (currently the AI is flawless and is making players frustrated). The client has suggested making it react slower or deliberately make mistakes; it is up to your discretion.

Further, the development team has left some poorly optimised code in the project which you need to identify and fix. It is also expected you polish elements of the game to provide the client an exceptional product. Write a list of five or more improvements of any type and implement one idea into the game - it is expected provided ideas go further than modifying a single value.

You have two hours to complete the provided tasks, this time excludes time required for accessing the project repository.
